  <h1>Contract Negotiation Team Roles and Responsibilities</h1>
  <p>This document defines the roles and responsibilities of each expert engaged in the preparation of a comprehensive contract negotiation document.

  <h2>Team Structure</h2>
  <p>The team consists of nine specialized roles: a Lead Negotiator, Business Expert, HR Expert, NDA Clause Writer, Policy Writer, Document Designer, HTML Coder, Project Director, and Content Compiler.

    <li><strong>Cross‑platform testing:</strong> Verify that the HTML renders correctly on multiple browsers and devices, making adjustments as needed.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Project Director</h3>
  <ul>

    <li><strong>Facilitate communication:</strong> Host check‑in meetings, resolve conflicts, and ensure team members have the resources they need.</li>

    <li><strong>Prepare final draft:</strong> Produce a polished document ready for review and approval by the Lead Negotiator and Project Director.</li>
